# Security Policy

## Concepts and Operations

Security Policy
: Rules that control network traffic by allowing or denying sessions based on traffic attributes (e.g.: Source and
Destination Zone)

**Operations**

- Evaluated top-down; once a match is found, further rules are not evaluated
- Policies are unidirectional and requires separate rules for traffic in each direction

## Sessions and Flows

Sessions
: A connection between two devices; each session is matched to a security policy rule. Each packet is matched to a
session.

**Flows**

- Single Flow: Multicast traffic (from one source to multiple destinations)
- Two Flows: Unicast raffic / TCP traffic (from one source to one destination)

## Security Policy Rule Types and Attributes

View Security Policies:

- `POLICIES > Security`

![Security Policies](security-policies.png)

### Rule Types

- Specifies if a rule applies to traffic within a zone, between zones, or both.
- Intrazone: Traffic within a zone
- Interzone: Traffic between zones
- Universal: Traffic within and between zones

### Custom vs Predefined Rules

Custom Rules
: User-defined rules by admiistrators to meet specific requirements of organisation
- (+) Greater flexibility and granular control over firewall's behaviour
- By default, all traffic is logged

Predefined Rules
: Default security rules pre-configured with PAN firewall. Provides basic security functionality.
- (-) Cannot be modified or deleted, but can be disabled or enabled
- By default, traffic is not logged

### Rule Hit Count

- Tracks how often a rule is matched
- Useful for identifying rules that are not being used
- Determines first and last usage timestamps
- Helpful in verifying configuration changes!

### Rule Shadowing

- When a rule is shadowed, it is not evaluated as a rule with higher priority has already matched the traffic
- To resolve: Reorder or refine rules

# Security Policy Rule Configuration

## Configuration Steps

### 1. Add New Rule

Add new rule: `POLICIES > Security > Add Rule`
![Add Rule](new-rule.png)

### 2. Source Tab

- Source Zone: Zone from which traffic originates (inside for internal traffic, outside for external traffic)
- Source Address: IP address/Region which traffic originates from (Default: Tick `Any`)
- Source User: User who is sending the traffic (Default: Tick `Any`)
- Source Device: Device from which traffic originates (Default: `Any`)

### 3. Destination Tab

- Destination Zone: Zone to which traffic is destined (inside/outside)
- Destination Address: IP address which traffic is destined to (Default: Tick `Any`)
- Destination Device: Device to which traffic is destined (Default: `Any`)

### 4. Application Tab

- Application: Application that is being used to send traffic
  - `Any` for services that are not application-specific (E.g. deny all traffic)
  - Specify application for application-specific services (E.g. facebook)

### 5. Service/URL Category Tab

- Service: Port number or service that is being used to send traffic (Default: `Any` for services and URL)

### 6. Actions Tab

- Action: Allow/Deny traffic
- Log Setting: Session End (or Start for troubleshooting)

> The default Intrazone and Interzone rules can be modified to be logged for troubleshooting by selecting the rule and
> clicking `Override`.

# NAT Policy

- Used to translate IP addresses and ports to allow traffic to flow between different networks.
- Two types: Source NAT (SNAT) and Destination NAT (DNAT)

## Source NAT (SNAT)

- For private users to access public internet (outbound traffic)
- Translates internal IP addresses to external public IP addresses
- Types:
  - Static IP: 1-1 fixed mapping; same internal IP always maps to same external IP with same port
  - Dynamic IP: 1-1 mapping of internal to external IP from a pool of public IPs; no port number translation
  - Dynamic IP and Port (DIPP): Multiple clients to 1 public IP with different source port numbers. Fewer public IPs
    needed.

### Configurations

> To enable Bidirectional SNAT, enable Bi-directional under the `Translated Packet (Source Addr Translation)` tab. 
> Note: Only for static NAT.

## Destination NAT (DNAT)

- For public users to access private servers (inbound traffic)
- Translates external IP addresses to internal IP addresses
- Configurations:
  - Static IP: 1-1 fixed translation without port number translation
  - Port Translation: Used when the destination server listens on a non-standard port.

### Configurations

- `POLICIES > NAT > Add`
- Similar to SNAT, but with different settings
